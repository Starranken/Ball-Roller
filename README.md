# Ball-Roller

Welcome to Ball Roller!
  This is my first 3D game made with unity, it is very basic, and I am planning on making it more complex with better graphics. 
The controls are WASD for moving around the game.

If you would like to play the game, Download the files provided, extract the files from the zip file, open the folder, and double click the .exe file.
